    "Universal Sequence Maps (USM) [1](#1) are a generalized version of the CGR maps first introduced by Jeffrey [2](#2) and they function as generalized order-free Markov transition matrices of symbolic sequences. This property in particular, allows for us to compute a generalized entropy estimate of the sequence based on the density of USM coordinates themselves. For more background on USM see the notebook demonstration ['demo_usm_make' ](demo_usm.ipynb). Vinga and Almeida  introduced a continuous quadratic Renyi entropy of the USM of DNA sequences in [3](#3) which demonstrated promising discriminatory power. We build off of their work by implementing their algorithms in python and generalizing their entropy measure to *d*-dimensional USM. Proofs of the generalized equations are included in the sections below. In many aspects the usm_entropy module uses the original javascript and matlab toolkit (found at the github repository [usm.github.com](https://github.com/usm/usm.github.com.git)) as a template, however, we make notable deviations from the original algorithms in order to implement the generalized equations and to be more pythonic.

    "## Terminology Introduction - Use this section as a glossary\n",
    "The topics presented in this notebook are highly cross-disciplinary and as such there are a variety of different terms used in the literature to refer to the same basic concepts. To ensure clarity of discussion we will define the following within the context of symbolic sequence analysis:\n",
    "* **Symbol** - a nominal data element which has no numeric magnitude in the general Euclidean sense. Symbols are common data types encountered in linguistics and natural language processing, information theory and cryptography as well as genomics. A symbol is congruous with a single category of a categorical variable. A symbol can be anything, including numbers, but it does not behave like regular numbers do as it is generally a proxy \"symbolizing\" some other construct.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sequence** or **Symbolic sequence** - a set of indexed symbols for which the order of the symbols is integral and thus object of analysis. Sequences are commonly encountered in genomics, time series analysis, linguistics and natural language processing, among others. Synonyms of sequence include strings, series, or sometimes vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Generating function** - a process or phenomenon which produces or is represented by a sequence of symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Alphabet** - the set of all possible symbols a generating function may produce. For example, if our sequence is a paragraph of a Charles Dickens novel, our generating function could be considered 19th century English typography, and our alphabet would be the 26 letters of the English alphabet plus each punctuation character and special character in use during that time. The term alphabet is congruous to the term \"state space\" from dynamical systems, in that the alphabet functions as the basic state space of a symbolic generating function. There are many different ways the size of an alphabet is refered to in the literature but for this discussion here we will refer to an alphabet's size as its dimension *d*.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **k-gram** - a subsequence of a longer sequence comprising of k sequential symbols. For example, if our sequence is \"ACTGGCA\", \"TG\" would be a k-gram with k=2. In symbolic sequence analysis we are often most interested in the frequency and patterns of k-grams of various lengths. Synonyms for k-gram include L-tuple, subsequence, words, motifs, sub-strings, or vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Suffix** - the k-gram occurring at the very end of a sequence. For \"ACTGGCA\", its length 3 suffix is the k-gram \"GCA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prefix** - the k-gram occurring at the very beginning of a sequence."

    "# Section 1 Renyi Continuous Entropy of USM\n",
    "Early on researchers suggested that the complexity of discrete patterns in a sequence could be measured by measuring the density distribution of the CGR and USM plots and Vinga and Almeida took this a step further in [3](#3) by proposing an entropy measure of USM plots that combines the continuous Renyi quadratic entropy with a Parzen kernel density estimate. The method uses a spherical symmetric Gaussian kernel with mean zero and diagonal covariance matrix $\\Sigma = \\sigma^2I_d$ where $I_d$ is the *dxd* identity matrix. The original paper establishing this measure only tests it for alphabets of size 4 so we must first generalize the equations to alphabets of arbitrary size *d*.

The Parzen window method takes a linear combination of smooth, continuous, differentiable weighting functions called the kernel function, one centered on each sample point $a_i$ in the observed sample. The output of this linear combination gives the estimated density function $\\hat{f}(x)$ of the distribution at all values of $x$. This is represented by the equation below where $x$ is the *d*-dimensional vector valued random variable in $\\mathbf{R}^d$, $a = \\left\\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_N\\right\\}$ is the sample of $x$ of size $N$, and $\\kappa()$ is the kernel weighting function applied to the distance between a value in $x$ and each $a_i$ in the sample $a$:\n",

    "# Section 3 Asymptotic Behavior of Renyi Entropy by Natural Log of Kernel Variance\n",
    "In the original paper, Vinga and Almeida [3](#3) explore the dependence relationship between the entropy measure and the kernel variance, $\\sigma^2$, with the graph of the function $H_2 = H_2(ln\\sigma^2)$ and prove this graph has two linear asymptotes of the forms $H_2^+ = \\lim_{ln\\sigma^2 \\to +\\infty} H_2(ln\\sigma^2) = m ln\\sigma^2 + b$ and $H_2^- = \\lim_{ln\\sigma^2 \\to -\\infty} H_2(ln\\sigma^2) = m' ln\\sigma^2 + b'$. Below are proofs of the equations of these asymptotes for the d-dimensional USM. "
